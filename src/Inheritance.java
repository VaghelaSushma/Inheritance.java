public class Inheritance {

	/* Why java does not have multiple inheritance?
	 * 
	 * Answer: Java does not have multiple inheritance because of ambiguity problem. In case of multiple inheritance, 
	 * a single class is derived from two or more parent classes. So, there may be a possibility that two or more
	 * parent classes have a member function with the same name. If the object of child class needs to access one of
	 * the same named member function from the parent class, then it results in ambiguity. The compiler is confused as 
	 * method of which parent class method to invoke on executing the call statement. */
